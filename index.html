        <h3 id="journey">My Journey So far</h3>
        <p>
            Where to start?  As a kid I was always this adventurous, goofy, smiling, and -dare I say- a little chubby kid.  I was always smiling, wherever I went.  I didn't care what I was doing, I was having fun.  I enjoyed ice cream, pizza, burgers, hanging out with my friends, and doing math.  Yes, you read that right.  I don't just like math, I <i>love</i> math.  Ever since I was in elementary school I always had a knack for it, always excelled in it.  For whatever reason I understand math better than most people.  I'm not complaining.
            <br>
            I spent the next few years in school being in excelled math and I loved it.  Throughout elementary school I got into a Trading Card Game/TV show called Yu-Gi-Oh! (this relates, I promise).  And because of that TV show, it actually brought out some of my interests, including wanting to go to Egypt, explore the great pyramids of Giza, see the great Sphinx, and explore as much as I could.  I later realized to get to that job would take a lot of boring work that I wasn't particularly interested in.  The next job I wanted to pursue was an astrophysicist.  I love theoretical physics, the concept of time and space, and thinking about the unknown.  There's so much to explore.  So I went into college hoping for a physics degree (the college I went to didn't offer an astrophyics degree, so that's the closest I could get).  I quickly realized I couldn't do physics (I can do math though, go figure), and switched to an Electrical Engineering major.  Mostly the same beginning classes.  Again, they required some physics which I actually couldn't pass.  So I thought, <i>what do I love?</i> and "math" came to mind.  So I switched to a math major and finished college with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics.  I did, however, have some hiccups along the way.  It wasn't smooth sailing (I actually ended up being "academically dismissed" because of my grades twice.  I was a good student, the way the education system is set up is not how my brain learns.  School has always been hard for me). So here I am, a math degree and no job that I looked into that interested me.  I found out programming schools, and went for it.  So here I am!

        <p>
        My background involves math, and lots of it.  As seen above, I have my math degree.  I learned some R while in school, and I taught myself some Python.  I also learned some HTML in middle school (I got to customize my MySpace page, back in the good ol' days), learned more HTML after college, as well as CSS and Javascript.

        <h3 id="other">Other Things About Me</h3>
        What do I like to do in my free time? I love doing math, programming, snowboarding, wakeboarding, biking, hiking, martial arts, gymnastics, cross-fit, playing the piano and guitar, among lots of other things I can't think of right now.
